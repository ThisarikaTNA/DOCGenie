Advanced Chatbot for Intelligent Question Answering and Dynamic Conversations : A sophisticated chatbot capable of intelligent question answering and dynamic conversations based on any document, leveraging Generative AI and Transformer models with Large Language Models (LLMs). This project utilized the OpenAI API with GPT models for human-like responses, fine-tuned LLMs for enhanced performance, implemented Langchain for seamless integration, and employed vector databases like Pinecone vectors and Faiss GPU for efficient data management and rapid retrieval. Additionally, embeddings were used to improve contextual understanding and semantic processing, showcasing the potential of advanced AI technologies in creating highly interactive and intelligent conversational agents.
